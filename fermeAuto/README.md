# Farm Simulation (JavaFX) 🌱🐄

Academic simulation project built in Java/JavaFX: a self-sustaining farm with a grid-based world, entities (plants/animals), seasons, resources and a shop system.

## Key features
- 6x6 grid farm simulation
- Entities: plants (wheat/tomato) and animals (chicken/cow)
- Resource management: water, food, fertiliser, storage
- Seasons with state changes and end-of-season selling logic
- JavaFX interface (store, warehouse stats, grid interactions)

## Tech stack
Java • JavaFX • OOP • Simulation engine • Git

## Project structure
- `src/` : source code
- `data/` : images + configuration
- `diagrammeDeClasse.mermaid` : class diagram

## How to run
> (To be filled: your Java version + command / IDE steps)
- Recommended: run `AppFX.java` (main entry point)


## Notes
This repository is an academic project repackaged as a clean, reproducible GitHub portfolio project.
